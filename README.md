Development files for Online Portfolio

These are the development files for the site cgeohagan.github.io, which is an online portfolio of some of my favorite Treehouse Tech Degree projects.
This project was created using HTML, CSS, Sass, JQuery, and Gulp. The folder 'development' includes all of the initial files (i.e., sass, original JQuery, etc.) 
The folder 'dist' contains all of the final files after minimizing CSS and JQuery and optimizing images. To run the gulpfile.js, use the command 'gulp' in the command line.
To deploy the changes in the 'dist' folder to the portfolio website, run the command 'gulp deploy.'
